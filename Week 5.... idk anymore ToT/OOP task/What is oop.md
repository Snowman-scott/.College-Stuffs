What is oop?

Object oriented programming allows code to be reused more easily, and make programs more modular and maintainable

OOP has Four pillars 

1. Encapsulation - The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data with a single unit (class), while hiding the internal implimentation details.

2. Abstraction - The Concept of hiding complex implimentations details and showing only the essential features of an object. Ths simpligies interfaces for users

3. Inheritance - A mechanism where a new class (child class) can inherit properties and methods from an existingclass (parent class). this promotes code reusability.

4. Polymorphism - The ability of objects to take on multiple forms. Allowing methods to behave differently based on the object calling them. The Two main types are:
    1. Compile-time polymorphism (method overloading): Multiple methods with the sme name but different paramaters
    
    2. Runtime polymorphism (method overiding): A subclass provides a specific implimentation of a method already defined in it's parent class
