WEEK 6 MY FAVE WEEK!

I MADE A LYRICS PRINTER!

IT SOO COOL!

I LOVED IT 

GOT THE IDEA FROM A TIKTOK AND MADE IT A REALITY!

Oh i also made the Yt downlaoder file

Im dyslexic hence the horrible spelling :3

Week 7 and 8 are where Yt downlaoder project got done 

All the pushes to github were in week 6 tho 

Enjoy looking at that :D

I have another Repo for That now
