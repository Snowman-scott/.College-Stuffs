Users need to be able to Select items on the menu, It should then allow the user to select a Time period (Start and end date) which will be checked to make sure it is in the data set. It will then Output a Graph to show the amount sold over that time period. A Line graph would be the best way to display this data as it allows for easy comparison of sales over time. The graph should also include a legend to display what the data represents. 
It will also output a table showing the total sales for each item in the selected time period as a line graph.

This makes it easy for users to read and understand the data. It makes the date be displayed in a meaningful way. and utilises the power of data visualization to enhance the user experience.

I am going to do the Line graph now.
